    "The population growth has always a demand for new housing, improving the facilities, enhancing the number of places of entertaintment, restaurants, and especially shopping malls. Nowadays, Most of the small families opt for entertaining in shoppling malls during weekend where they can find vast amount of opportunities for themselves as parents and for their children. Therefore, New York city has its potential for need-based built shopping malls. With this study, we will conduct a research on finding useful insights that would be necessary for determining the location for a new shopping mall. "

Regardless of any region of the city (e.g. north, west, etc.), each neighborhood is of interest to the stakeholders. Therefore, all of them will be clearly examined and the one that essentially needs a shopping mall will be found out.  "
